# Godot Video Game Design
This is a project made for Colorado TSA States.

All assets should go inside the asset folder, and even then under the correct directory. Ie: Scripts need to be in the Scripts folder, Sprites in the Sprites, etc

Scenes that you are working on should be inside of your named folder. 

There will be a main build located in the main-build folder. This will be periodically merged and updated after the group is notified.

You should only be adding scenes into YOUR folder. Do NOT delete assests until checking with everyone that it is ok to delete.

There are multiple .txt files under different folders, please read them and pay attention! They explain the folders purpose / something important.
