# Godot Video Game Design
This is a project made for Colorado TSA States.

All assets should go inside the asset folder, and even then under the correct directory. Ie: Scripts need to be in the Scripts folder, Sprites in the Sprites, etc

Scenes that you are working on should be inside of your named folder. 

There will be a main build located in the main-build folder. This will be periodically merged and updated after the group is notified.

You should only be adding scenes into YOUR folder. Do NOT delete assests until checking with everyone that it is ok to delete.

There are multiple .txt files under different folders, please read them and pay attention! They explain the folders purpose / something important.

**ALWAYS PULL FROM GITHUB BEFORE YOU START WORKING. THIS IT TO AVOID MERGE ISSUES. IF YOU ARE PRESENTED WITH A MERGE ISSUE TALK TO ELIJAH, AND I WILL FIGURE OUT WHICH ONE IS RIGHT TO MERGE.**

### Github tutorial
Whenever you start the project, use the software you are using (Github Desktop or GitKraken) to pull all new updates from the cloud.

There are two different "upload" things, commit and push.

Committing is just writing a message and uploading the files you have selected into the queue.

Pushing is taking all the files you have put into the queue and sending them to be uploaded to the server, and this webpage. 

You should try to commit somewhat frequently, but only push and pull when you are starting / finishing work for the day/session.


# Commit all csproj,sln,import files, do not commit .vs folder or .godot folder
